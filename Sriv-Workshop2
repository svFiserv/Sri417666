## Ignore markdown formatting

You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.

Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.

Without \ character:

Let's rename *our-new-project* to *our-old-project*.

[!NOTE] Note the difference. Without the escape character, backslash \, text shows in italics.
